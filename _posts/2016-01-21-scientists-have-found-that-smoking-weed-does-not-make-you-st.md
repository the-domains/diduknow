description: "You might have heard that smoking marijuana makes you stupid. If you grew up in the '80s or '90s, that was more or less the take-home message of countless anti-drug PSAs. In more recent years, it's a message we've heard - albeit in more nuanced form - from Republican candidates on the campaign trail and from marijuana opponents at the state-level."
