      Body language affects how others see us, but it may also change how we see
      ourselves. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy shows how "power posing" --
      standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don't feel confident --
      can affect testosterone and cortisol levels in the brain, and might even
      have an impact on our chances for success.

  we think, behave, and react? And even if we come to know how the brain works,
  are we limited by our underlying circuitry or can we overcome our limitations?
