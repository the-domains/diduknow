description: "In 2014, more Americans died of drug overdoses than any other year on record: more than 47,000 deaths in just one year, according to new federal data. That's far more than the nearly 34,000 who died to car crashes, the almost 34,000 who died to gun violence, and the nearly 42,000 who died to HIV/AIDS during that epidemic's peak in 1995."
