description: 'People have been growing and using marijuana for thousands of years. Ancient texts praised the plant for its versatility - it was used for its psychoactive and medical effects and to make clothes and paper. But in 1934, the US effectively banned the plant with strict taxes and regulations - a prohibition that, despite some major changes to the regulatory model, remains to this day.'
