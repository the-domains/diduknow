      If you forget a name or two, take longer to finish the crossword, or find
      it hard to manage two tasks at once, you're not on the road to dementia.
      What you're experiencing is your brain changing the way it works as you
      get older. And in many ways it's actually working better.

  If, like me, you grew up with a hyper-reactive nervous system that constantly
  made you feel overwhelmed, alienated and unlovable, finding a substance that
  eases social stress becomes a blessed escape. For me, heroin provided a sense
  of comfort, safety and love that I couldn't get from other people (the key
  agent of addiction in these regions is the same for many pleasurable
  experiences: dopamine).
