description: "The war on drugs technically began in the 1970s, with the passage of the Controlled Substances Act, President Richard Nixon's speech to Congress, and the enactment of anti-drug laws and policies that followed. But drug prohibition has been federal policy for 100 years. This timeline covers the policy all the way back to the late 19th century."
