            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>If Anyone Tells You Marijuana Is a Gateway Drug, Show Them This</h1><p>One of the most common arguments about drug use is that marijuana is a gateway drug. Some claim smoking weed puts young people on a slippery slope to other hard drugs like cocaine, heroin or amphetamines. Drug warriors often cite this idea when arguing in favor of continued marijuana prohibition.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/42cae4e6b880a2cbfa2deca30ec89c1de0ce2b2e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>US government finally admits cannabis kills cancer cells</h1><p>The US government has thrown its weight behind the earth-shattering claims that cannabis kills cancer cells. Everyone from hippies to conspiracy theorists and even several creditable scientists have previously argued that smoking or ingesting the herb can have medicinal benefits.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Effects of Chronic Heavy Drinking on Brain Function Are Underdiagnosed</h1><p>Here's a sobering thought for the holidays: Chronic heavy drinking can cause insidious damage to the brain, even in people who never seem intoxicated or obviously addicted. Experts say alcohol-related brain damage is underdiagnosed and often confused with Alzheimer's disease, other forms of dementia or just getting older.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b294c1c001f41d8b66185ec9720f30b2d5b1b81e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Scientists have found that smoking weed does not make you stupid after all</h1><p>You might have heard that smoking marijuana makes you stupid. If you grew up in the '80s or '90s, that was more or less the take-home message of countless anti-drug PSAs. In more recent years, it's a message we've heard - albeit in more nuanced form - from Republican candidates on the campaign trail and from marijuana opponents at the state-level.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/16bf8823df84f41f3875c01ae8677c57277caa0a.jpg"></article>]]></description>
