            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>24 maps and charts that explain marijuana</h1><p>People have been growing and using marijuana for thousands of years. Ancient texts praised the plant for its versatility - it was used for its psychoactive and medical effects and to make clothes and paper. But in 1934, the US effectively banned the plant with strict taxes and regulations - a prohibition that, despite some major changes to the regulatory model, remains to this day.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/64afa65141c1bb371071a3e54f673dae6ad88983.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The risks of alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs, explained</h1><p>Researchers have said for years that alcohol is more dangerous than marijuana. But what does that mean, exactly? And how do we know? It's certainly not because of any government-acknowledged evaluation. The federal government's scheduling system evaluates drugs by medical value, first, and abuse potential, which is poorly defined under the law, second - but it excludes alcohol and tobacco altogether.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/89bd793525f15029d5c1f7d3882195293b0499c5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How scientists rank drugs from most to least dangerous - and why the rankings are flawed</h1><p>There's a very common drug-policy talking point that's meant to convey the absurdity of the war on drugs: Alcohol is more dangerous than marijuana, even though alcohol is legal and marijuana is not. Perhaps the biggest supporting evidence for this point is a 2010 study published in The Lancet that ranked alcohol as the most dangerous drug in the United Kingdom, surpassing heroin, crack cocaine, and marijuana.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b2cb7334b203723f1cfe84cb69d7ad21f8941051.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I'm a doctor. I worry every time I prescribe painkillers to a patient.</h1><p>"Please, I need my Oxycodone!" my patient, M, pleaded with me. My eyes met his. I observed every fleeting facial expression, hoping to gauge his intentions. The discussion about whether to continue to prescribe this medication was one I'd had too many times with too many patients over the past few months.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5ee54b25a83dcf8030eec4b5a67b702ca490aef4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Watch: A neuroscientist debunks common beliefs about drug addiction</h1><p>Carl Hart is a neuroscientist and drug addiction expert at Columbia University. In a recent TEDMED talk, Hart spoke about drug addiction and the many misconceptions surrounding the topic - and how those misconceptions can mislead drug policy. Hart went into neuroscience to cure the drug addiction he blamed for causing crime and poverty in his old Miami neighborhood.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/47559ed6d18c394a5a761ae9bb8216b2a83f4188.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Addiction: The View from Rat Park (2010)</h1><p>When I talk to addicted people, whether they are addicted to alcohol, drugs, gambling, Internet use, sex, or anything else, I encounter human beings who really do not have a viable social or cultural life. They use their addictions as a way of coping with their dislocation: as an escape, a pain killer, or a kind of substitute for a full life.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c3ac52f6714b50775a608dde4947e18b7ebbc70e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
