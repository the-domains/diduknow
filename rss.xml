            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>If Anyone Tells You Marijuana Is a Gateway Drug, Show Them This</h1><p>One of the most common arguments about drug use is that marijuana is a gateway drug. Some claim smoking weed puts young people on a slippery slope to other hard drugs like cocaine, heroin or amphetamines. Drug warriors often cite this idea when arguing in favor of continued marijuana prohibition.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/42cae4e6b880a2cbfa2deca30ec89c1de0ce2b2e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Helping Someone Who Wants to Leave Treatment Early</h1><p>It's a huge decision to come into addiction treatment. Everyone comes in with a degree of ambivalence. When the community of patients is working well you find that people recognise this ambivalence in each other. An empathic approach is usually more effective than attempts to 'persuade'.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ee8add0796d32a3146b119380af16f4f7727c3c4.jpg"></article>]]></description>
