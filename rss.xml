            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>If Anyone Tells You Marijuana Is a Gateway Drug, Show Them This</h1><p>One of the most common arguments about drug use is that marijuana is a gateway drug. Some claim smoking weed puts young people on a slippery slope to other hard drugs like cocaine, heroin or amphetamines. Drug warriors often cite this idea when arguing in favor of continued marijuana prohibition.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/42cae4e6b880a2cbfa2deca30ec89c1de0ce2b2e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Her Tattoo Says "I'm Fine," But Look At It From Another Angle ... The Message Is Shocking</h1><p>Getting a tattoo is a big decision. It will stay with you for the rest of your life and will be one of your defining characteristics.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Effects of Chronic Heavy Drinking on Brain Function Are Underdiagnosed</h1><p>Here's a sobering thought for the holidays: Chronic heavy drinking can cause insidious damage to the brain, even in people who never seem intoxicated or obviously addicted. Experts say alcohol-related brain damage is underdiagnosed and often confused with Alzheimer's disease, other forms of dementia or just getting older.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b294c1c001f41d8b66185ec9720f30b2d5b1b81e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Scientists have found that smoking weed does not make you stupid after all</h1><p>You might have heard that smoking marijuana makes you stupid. If you grew up in the '80s or '90s, that was more or less the take-home message of countless anti-drug PSAs. In more recent years, it's a message we've heard - albeit in more nuanced form - from Republican candidates on the campaign trail and from marijuana opponents at the state-level.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/16bf8823df84f41f3875c01ae8677c57277caa0a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Synthetic marijuana: What is it, how does it work, and is it dangerous?</h1><p>Marijuana is generally considered one of the least harmful illicit drugs. But synthetic marijuana, the label given to a group of manufactured drugs derived from pot's cannabinoids, couldn't be any more different - and in recent months it's fostered a growing sense of concern among public health officials.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/213373b92860370711e35596ebeeb64be65f1738.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Timeline: 100 years of drug prohibition</h1><p>The war on drugs technically began in the 1970s, with the passage of the Controlled Substances Act, President Richard Nixon's speech to Congress, and the enactment of anti-drug laws and policies that followed. But drug prohibition has been federal policy for 100 years. This timeline covers the policy all the way back to the late 19th century.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/59f237c8c3d5b6d1baa50efb0a0f1afb69fc6814.jpg"></article>]]></description>
