            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>If Anyone Tells You Marijuana Is a Gateway Drug, Show Them This</h1><p>One of the most common arguments about drug use is that marijuana is a gateway drug. Some claim smoking weed puts young people on a slippery slope to other hard drugs like cocaine, heroin or amphetamines. Drug warriors often cite this idea when arguing in favor of continued marijuana prohibition.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8c56793ff58b5c2dca55fcac20723305ca946cf2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

But synthetic marijuana, the label given to a group of manufactured drugs derived from pot's cannabinoids, couldn't be any more different - and in recent months it's fostered a growing sense of concern among public health officials.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/213373b92860370711e35596ebeeb64be65f1738.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Timeline: 100 years of drug prohibition</h1><p>The war on drugs technically began in the 1970s, with the passage of the Controlled Substances Act, President Richard Nixon's speech to Congress, and the enactment of anti-drug laws and policies that followed. But drug prohibition has been federal policy for 100 years.

It's arguable that one of the biggest campaign promises made by Canada's new Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, was his goal to legalize cannabis countrywide. In the US, cannabis is legal in some form in 23 states, and with that we see a staggering number we [...]</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2fbab27feff7e9fbb57fd482144974cd38b7ba1c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
