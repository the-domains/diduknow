Some claim smoking weed puts young people on a slippery slope to other hard drugs like cocaine, heroin or amphetamines. Drug warriors often cite this idea when arguing in favor of continued marijuana prohibition.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/42cae4e6b880a2cbfa2deca30ec89c1de0ce2b2e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
