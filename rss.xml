            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Effects of Chronic Heavy Drinking on Brain Function Are Underdiagnosed</h1><p>Here's a sobering thought for the holidays: Chronic heavy drinking can cause insidious damage to the brain, even in people who never seem intoxicated or obviously addicted. Experts say alcohol-related brain damage is underdiagnosed and often confused with Alzheimer's disease, other forms of dementia or just getting older.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b294c1c001f41d8b66185ec9720f30b2d5b1b81e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Scientists have found that smoking weed does not make you stupid after all</h1><p>You might have heard that smoking marijuana makes you stupid. If you grew up in the '80s or '90s, that was more or less the take-home message of countless anti-drug PSAs. In more recent years, it's a message we've heard - albeit in more nuanced form - from Republican candidates on the campaign trail and from marijuana opponents at the state-level.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/16bf8823df84f41f3875c01ae8677c57277caa0a.jpg"></article>]]></description>
