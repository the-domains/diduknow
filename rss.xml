            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Synthetic marijuana: What is it, how does it work, and is it dangerous?</h1><p>Marijuana is generally considered one of the least harmful illicit drugs. But synthetic marijuana, the label given to a group of manufactured drugs derived from pot's cannabinoids, couldn't be any more different - and in recent months it's fostered a growing sense of concern among public health officials.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6d3efb80bd004193274caec628dcbd88c105df38.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>If Anyone Tells You Marijuana Is a Gateway Drug, Show Them This</h1><p>One of the most common arguments about drug use is that marijuana is a gateway drug. Some claim smoking weed puts young people on a slippery slope to other hard drugs like cocaine, heroin or amphetamines. Drug warriors often cite this idea when arguing in favor of continued marijuana prohibition.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4781613dd18a2817a5e6754141d7caf91d2c0f2b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

But drug prohibition has been federal policy for 100 years.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Report: Here's How Many People Fatally Overdosed On Marijuana In 2015</h1><p>Marijuana legalization has been the talk of North America for years now. It's arguable that one of the biggest campaign promises made by Canada's new Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, was his goal to legalize cannabis countrywide.

That's far more than the nearly 34,000 who died to car crashes, the almost 34,000 who died to gun violence, and the nearly 42,000 who died to HIV/AIDS during that epidemic's peak in 1995.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/77dc4198476cf0d5b5c6b5ca82129ecf4d653aed.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>24 maps and charts that explain marijuana</h1><p>People have been growing and using marijuana for thousands of years. Ancient texts praised the plant for its versatility - it was used for its psychoactive and medical effects and to make clothes and paper. But in 1934, the US effectively banned the plant with strict taxes and regulations - a prohibition that, despite some major changes to the regulatory model, remains to this day.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/64afa65141c1bb371071a3e54f673dae6ad88983.jpg"></article>]]></description>
